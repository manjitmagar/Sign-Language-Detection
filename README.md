# Sign-Language-Detection
Developed a real-time sign language recognition system using computer vision and deep learning. The application detects hand gestures via webcam using cvzone's HandTrackingModule, processes the hand image, and classifies the gesture using a trained Keras/TensorFlow model. The system utilizes OpenCV for video processing and TFLite/Keras for efficient model inference. It supports real-time gesture classification with dynamic bounding boxes and live label overlays. This project showcases skills in computer vision, deep learning, and real-time application development using Python.
